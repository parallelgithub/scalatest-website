<h1>Getting started with <code>FeatureSpec</code></h1>

<p>
By learning to use <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.FeatureSpec"><code>FeatureSpec</code></a>, <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.GivenWhenThen"><code>GivenWhenThen</code></a>, simple <a href="/user_guide/using_assertions">assertions</a>, and the <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfter"><code>BeforeAndAfter</code></a> trait, you can become
productive in the acceptance testing style of ScalaTest very quickly. You can then learn and use more of ScalaTest over time.
</p>

<p>
In a <code>FeatureSpec</code>, you describe <em>scenarios</em> of <em>features</em>. The structure looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
 
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FeatureSpec</span> {
 
  feature(<span class="stQuotedString">"The user can pop an element off the top of the stack"</span>) {
 
    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on a non-empty stack"</span>) (pending)
 
    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on an empty stack"</span>) (pending)
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Each scenario in a <code>FeatureSpec</code> is one ScalaTest test. The scenarios are marked pending in the previous example
to indicate the tests have not yet been implemented. You can compile this <code>FeatureSpec</code> like this:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
$ scalac -cp scalatest-@{latestVersion}.jar ExampleSpec.scala
</pre>

<p>
When you run it, the feature/scenario structure shows up in the output:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
$ scala -cp scalatest-@{latestVersion}.jar org.scalatest.run ExampleSpec
<span class="cyanincolor">Run starting. Expected test count is: 2</span>
<span class="greenincolor">ExampleSpec:
Feature: The user can pop an element off the top of the stack</span>
  <span class="yellowincolor">Scenario: pop is invoked on a non-empty stack (pending)
  Scenario: pop is invoked on an empty stack (pending)</span>
<span class="cyanincolor">Run completed in 65 milliseconds.
Total number of tests run: 0
Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
Tests: succeeded 0, failed 0, ignored 0, pending 2</span>
<span class="greenincolor">All tests passed.</span>
</pre>

<p>
If you wish, you can flesh out the specification by mixing in <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.GivenWhenThen"><code>GivenWhenThen</code></a> and adding extra information about the scenarios, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.GivenWhenThen
 
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FeatureSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">GivenWhenThen</span> {
 
  feature(<span class="stQuotedString">"The user can pop an element off the top of the stack"</span>) {
 
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"As a programmer"</span>)
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"I want to be able to pop items off the stack"</span>)
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"So that I can get them in last-in-first-out order"</span>)
 
    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on a non-empty stack"</span>) {
 
      Given(<span class="stQuotedString">"a non-empty stack"</span>)
      When(<span class="stQuotedString">"when pop is invoked on the stack"</span>)
      Then(<span class="stQuotedString">"the most recently pushed element should be returned"</span>)
      And(<span class="stQuotedString">"the stack should have one less item than before"</span>)
      pending
    }
 
    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on an empty stack"</span>) {
 
      Given(<span class="stQuotedString">"an empty stack"</span>)
      When(<span class="stQuotedString">"when pop is invoked on the stack"</span>)
      Then(<span class="stQuotedString">"NoSuchElementException should be thrown"</span>)
      And(<span class="stQuotedString">"the stack should still be empty"</span>)
      pending
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
When you run this version of <code>ExampleSpec</code>, you'll see the extra information in the report:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
$ scala -cp scalatest-1.8.jar org.scalatest.run ExampleSpec
<span class="cyanincolor">Run starting. Expected test count is: 2</span>
<span class="greenincolor">ExampleSpec:

  Scenario: pop is invoked on an empty stack (pending)
    Given an empty stack 
    When when pop is invoked on the stack 
    Then NoSuchElementException should be thrown 
    And the stack should still be empty</span>
<span class="cyanincolor">Run completed in 112 milliseconds.
Total number of tests run: 0
Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
Tests: succeeded 0, failed 0, ignored 0, pending 2</span>
<span class="greenincolo">All tests passed.</span>
</pre>

<p>
When you can't put off writing the actual tests themselves any longer, you can fill them in. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.GivenWhenThen
<span class="stReserved">import</span> scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FeatureSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">GivenWhenThen</span> {
 
  feature(<span class="stQuotedString">"The user can pop an element off the top of the stack"</span>) {
 
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"As a programmer"</span>)
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"I want to be able to pop items off the stack"</span>)
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"So that I can get them in last-in-first-out order"</span>)

    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on a non-empty stack"</span>) {
 
      Given(<span class="stQuotedString">"a non-empty stack"</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> stack = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Stack[Int]</span>
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> oldSize = stack.size
 
      When(<span class="stQuotedString">"when pop is invoked on the stack"</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> result = stack.pop()
 
      Then(<span class="stQuotedString">"the most recently pushed element should be returned"</span>)
      assert(result === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
 
      And(<span class="stQuotedString">"the stack should have one less item than before"</span>)
      assert(stack.size === oldSize - <span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
    }
 
    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on an empty stack"</span>) {
 
      Given(<span class="stQuotedString">"an empty stack"</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> emptyStack = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Stack[Int]</span>
 
      When(<span class="stQuotedString">"when pop is invoked on the stack"</span>)
      Then(<span class="stQuotedString">"NoSuchElementException should be thrown"</span>)
      intercept[<span class="stType">NoSuchElementException</span>] {
        emptyStack.pop()
      }
 
      And(<span class="stQuotedString">"the stack should still be empty"</span>)
      assert(emptyStack.isEmpty)
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Now when you run <code>ExampleSpec</code> you'll see the tests are no longer reported as pending:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
$ scala -cp scalatest-@{latestVersion}.jar org.scalatest.run ExampleSpec
<span class="cyanincolor">Run starting. Expected test count is: 2</span>
<span class="greenincolor">ExampleSpec:

    Given a non-empty stack 
    When when pop is invoked on the stack 
    Then the most recently pushed element should be returned 
    And the stack should have one less item than before

    Then NoSuchElementException should be thrown 
    And the stack should still be empty </span>
<span class="cyanincolor">Run completed in 96 milliseconds.
Total number of tests run: 2
Suites: completed 1, aborted 0
Tests: succeeded 2, failed 0, ignored 0, pending 0</span>
<span class="greenincolor">All tests passed.</span>
</pre>

<h2>Using assertions</h2>

<p>
To get started quickly with ScalaTest, learn to use <code>assert</code> with the <code>===</code> operator
and <code>intercept</code>. Later if you prefer you can switch to <a href="/user_guide/using_matchers">ScalaTest's matchers</a>.
</p>

<p>
ScalaTest lets you use Scala's assertion syntax, but defines a triple equals operator (<code>===</code>) to give you better error messages. The following
code would give you an error indicating only that an assertion failed:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
assert(<span class="stLiteral">1</span> == <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
</pre>

<p>
Using triple equals instead would give you the more informative error message, <code>"1 did not equal 2"</code>:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
assert(<span class="stLiteral">1</span> === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
</pre>

<p>
To test whether a bit of code produces an expected exception, use <code>intercept</code>. Place the expected exception type in 
square brackets after <code>intercept</code>, and the bit of code in curly braces, like this:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> s = <span class="stQuotedString">"hi"</span>
intercept[<span class="stType">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span>] {
  s.charAt(-<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
}
</pre>

<p>
If the bit of code between the curly braces throws the expected exception, <code>intercept</code> will return it. In the previous example that return value was ignored. 
If you want to inspect the thrown exception, you can do so like this:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">val</span> s = <span class="stQuotedString">"hi"</span>
val thrown = intercept[<span class="stType">IndexOutOfBoundsException</span>] {
  s.charAt(-<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
}
assert(thrown.getMessage === <span class="stLiteral">"String index out of range: -1"</span>)
</pre>

<p>
If the bit of code between the curly braces throws the wrong exception, or does not throw any exception, you'll get a test failure describing
the problem.
</p>

<h2>Factoring out duplicate code</h2>

<p>
If you want to factor out duplicate code from tests, mix in <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfter"><code>BeforeAndAfter</code></a>, surround the code you
want to run before each test by <code>before { ... }</code>, and after each test by <code>after { ... }</code>. Here's an example that just uses <code>before</code>:
</p>

<pre class="stHighlighted">
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.FeatureSpec
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.GivenWhenThen
<span class="stReserved">import</span> org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfter
<span class="stReserved">import</span> scala.collection.mutable.Stack
 
<span class="stReserved">class</span> <span class="stType">ExampleSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">extends</span> <span class="stType">FeatureSpec</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">GivenWhenThen</span> <span class="stReserved">with</span> <span class="stType">BeforeAndAfter</span> {
 
  <span class="stReserved">var</span> stack: <span class="stType">Stack[Int]</span> = _

  before {
    stack = <span class="stReserved">new</span> <span class="stType">Stack[Int]</span>
  }

  feature(<span class="stQuotedString">"The user can pop an element off the top of the stack"</span>) {
 
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"As a programmer"</span>)
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"I want to be able to pop items off the stack"</span>)
    info(<span class="stQuotedString">"So that I can get them in last-in-first-out order"</span>)

    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on a non-empty stack"</span>) {
 
      Given(<span class="stQuotedString">"a non-empty stack"</span>)
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
      stack.push(<span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> oldSize = stack.size
 
      When(<span class="stQuotedString">"when pop is invoked on the stack"</span>)
      <span class="stReserved">val</span> result = stack.pop()
 
      Then(<span class="stQuotedString">"the most recently pushed element should be returned"</span>)
      assert(result === <span class="stLiteral">2</span>)
 
      And(<span class="stQuotedString">"the stack should have one less item than before"</span>)
      assert(stack.size === oldSize - <span class="stLiteral">1</span>)
    }
 
    scenario(<span class="stQuotedString">"pop is invoked on an empty stack"</span>) {
 
      Given(<span class="stQuotedString">"an empty stack"</span>)
      When(<span class="stQuotedString">"when pop is invoked on the stack"</span>)
      Then(<span class="stQuotedString">"NoSuchElementException should be thrown"</span>)
      intercept[<span class="stType">NoSuchElementException</span>] {
        stack.pop()
      }
 
      And(<span class="stQuotedString">"the stack should still be empty"</span>)
      assert(stack.isEmpty)
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
You compile and run it the same way:
</p>

<pre class="scala">
$ scalac -cp scalatest-@{latestVersion}.jar ExampleSpec.scala
$ scala -cp scalatest-@{latestVersion}.jar org.scalatest.run ExampleSpec
